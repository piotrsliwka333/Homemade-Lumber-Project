where everybody will able to give back unused items
(clothes,toys etc.)
 to trusted institutions.
 
 ### Where did the idea come from ?
 
 * User have in home things which wants to get rid of
 but doesn't know how.
 
 * There are many solutions available, but many require additional effort or are not trusted.
 
 * Verified places usually are far and nobody has time to go there.
